[00:15.40] Gonna build myself a castle
[00:21.53] High up in the clouds
[00:28.55] There'll be skies outside my window,
[00:36.21] Lose these streets and crowds
[00:50.71] 
[00:57.52] Dance the night away
[01:07.52] 
[01:13.92] Will find myself an ocean;
[01:20.95] Sail into the blue
[01:28.42] Live with golden swordfish;
[01:36.26] Forget the time of you
[01:47.26] 
[01:56.90] Dance the night away
[02:06.90] 
[02:14.09] Dance myself to nothing;
[02:20.65] Vanish from this place
[02:27.98] Gonna turn myself to shadow
[02:35.69] So I can't see your face
[02:47.69] 
[02:54.35] Dance the night away
